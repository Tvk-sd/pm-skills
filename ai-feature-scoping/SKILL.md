name: ai-feature-scoping
description: Rigorously scope an AI product feature covering value proposition, accuracy thresholds, failure modes, build/buy options, and measurement. Use when the user wants to scope or de-risk an AI feature. Trigger phrases include: "scope this AI feature", "AI feature feasibility", "evaluate this AI idea", "plan an AI feature", "is this AI worth building".
---

This skill scopes AI features rigorously, covering dimensions traditional feature scoping misses: accuracy thresholds, failure modes, false positive/negative trade-offs, and ongoing operational costs.

## Required inputs

Ask for: product name, proposed AI feature, available data/models, target user and context, current state (how users do this today).

## Scoping dimensions

### 1. Value Proposition Clarity
- What specific user outcome does this improve, and by how much?
- Is AI the right solution, or would a deterministic approach (rules, filters, templates) achieve 80% of value at 20% complexity? Be honest.

### 2. Accuracy and Failure Mode Analysis
- What is the minimum accuracy threshold for this to be useful vs. annoying?
- What happens when the AI is wrong? Categorise by severity: embarrassing / costly / dangerous
- What is the cost of a false positive vs. false negative for this use case?
- How will users recover from or correct AI errors?

### 3. Scope — Three Tiers

| Tier | Focus |
|---|---|
| MVP | Minimum viable AI that delivers core value |
| V1 | Confidence and reliability improvements |
| V2 | Full vision with personalisation and learning |

For each tier: capabilities in/out, data requirements, expected accuracy range, key risks.

### 4. Build vs. Buy vs. API
- What is available off-the-shelf?
- What requires custom development?
- Where are the moat / differentiation opportunities?

### 5. Measurement Framework
- How will you know if the AI is actually helping users?
- What leading indicators will you track before outcome metrics?
- How will you detect model degradation over time?

## Constraints

- If this is "AI for AI's sake" without clear user value, say so directly
- Do not assume unlimited data availability or quality
- Account for ongoing operational costs — not just build cost
- Consider regulatory and privacy implications explicitly
