version: 1.0.0
name: stakeholder-communication
description: Draft audience-adapted stakeholder updates, status reports, or exec communications. Use when the user needs to write an update, status email, board communication, or cross-functional message. Trigger phrases include: "write a stakeholder update", "draft a status update", "exec communication", "write an update for leadership", "communicate this to the team".
---

**Before starting:** present a brief work plan — what you will do and in what order — plus any clarifying questions, and wait for confirmation before proceeding.

This skill produces crisp, audience-adapted communications that lead with the most important thing and don't bury bad news.

## Required inputs

Ask for:
- What happened (key developments, decisions, milestones)
- Current status — including problems
- Key metrics and trends
- Decisions needed from stakeholders
- Audience (exec team, engineering, customer success, board, etc.)

---

## Process

### Audience Analysis (before writing)
Reason through:
- What does this audience care most about? (Revenue? Timeline? Technical risk? Customer impact?)
- What is the ONE thing they need to take away?
- What concerns will they have that should be addressed preemptively?
- What action is needed from them, if any?

### Update structure

1. **BLUF** — Bottom Line Up Front: one sentence, most important takeaway
2. **Key metrics** — 2–3 data points maximum
3. **On track / at risk** — be specific ("2-week delay on auth integration due to API partner dependency" not "timeline risk")
4. **Decisions needed** — with clear deadlines and owners
5. **What's next** — upcoming milestones with dates

If multiple audiences are specified, create separate versions tailored to each group's priorities and vocabulary. Maintain factual consistency; adjust emphasis and framing.

---

## Constraints

- Maximum 300 words per audience version
- No burying bad news — lead with risks if they are the most important development
- No PM jargon for non-PM audiences (no "velocity", "sprint", "backlog" for execs)
- Every risk mentioned must include a mitigation plan or explicit ask for help
- Do not soften language on blockers — executives respect directness over optimism

---

## File output

After producing the final output, save it as a markdown file in the current working directory:

```
Filename: [project-slug]-STAKEHOLDER-UPDATE.md
```

If no project slug is evident from context, ask the user for one before saving. Confirm the save with: `Saved: [filename]`

---

## Progressive Updates

Whenever the user explicitly states not to do something (e.g. "don't ask for X", "stop doing Y", "never include Z"), automatically edit the role and behaviour description at the top of this SKILL.md to reflect that constraint permanently. This ensures the skill adapts to user preferences over time without requiring repeated instructions.
