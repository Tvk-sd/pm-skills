name: user-story-creation
description: Generate implementation-ready user stories with acceptance criteria, edge cases, and complexity estimates. Use when the user needs to write user stories, acceptance criteria, or break down a feature for engineering. Trigger phrases include: "write user stories", "break this into stories", "acceptance criteria", "story map", "tickets for this feature".
---

This skill produces engineering-ready user stories — not formulaic shells. It forces edge case reasoning before writing acceptance criteria, producing stories QA can test directly.

## Required inputs

Ask the user for:
- Feature name and description or PRD section
- Target user types
- Technical stack or constraints (if known)

---

## Process — for each story

**1. Write the story**
Format: As a [user type], I want [action] so that [outcome]

**2. Reason through edge cases first** (before writing ACs)
- Error and failure states
- Boundary conditions
- Permissions and access controls
- Interactions with existing features

**3. Write acceptance criteria**
Format: Given / When / Then
- Must be specific enough for a QA engineer to write test cases directly
- No ambiguous language ("appropriate", "reasonable")
- Include at least one negative test case (what should NOT happen)

**4. Assign complexity** (S/M/L) with brief justification

**5. List dependencies** on other stories or systems

## Grouping and prioritisation

Group stories by user journey phase:
- Discovery → Activation → Core usage → Edge cases

Prioritise each group: Must / Should / Could

---

## Constraints

- Each story must be independently deliverable and testable
- If a story is too large for a single sprint, flag it and suggest how to split
- Do not generate stories for functionality not described — instead, list gaps under "Suggested additions"
