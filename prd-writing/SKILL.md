name: prd-writing
description: Write a structured, stakeholder-ready PRD using a two-phase approach — strategic questioning first, then structured drafting. Use when the user needs to write a PRD, product brief, or feature spec. Trigger phrases include: "write a PRD", "help me draft a spec", "product requirements", "feature brief", "write up this feature".
---

This skill produces implementation-ready PRDs through a two-phase process. Phase 1 surfaces critical questions before any drafting begins. Phase 2 produces a structured document with explicit assumption and input markers.

## Required inputs

Ask the user for:
- Company/product context and target users
- Feature or initiative name
- Rough notes or thinking so far
- Their PRD template (always prefer their actual template over a default)

---

## Phase 1 — Strategic Challenge

Before drafting anything, identify the 5 most critical questions the user must answer for the PRD to be strong. For each:
- Explain why it matters
- Flag assumptions in their brief that need validation
- Suggest how to answer it (data source, stakeholder, experiment)

Ask these questions and **wait for responses** before proceeding to Phase 2.

## Phase 2 — Structured Draft

Draft the PRD using the user's template. If none provided, use:

1. Problem Statement
2. Goals & Success Metrics
3. User Stories
4. Scope (In / Out)
5. Solution Design
6. Technical Considerations
7. Risks & Mitigations
8. Launch Plan
9. Open Questions

For each section:
- Write substantive content, not placeholders
- Flag assumptions: `[ASSUMPTION: reason]`
- Flag input needed: `[NEEDS INPUT: who and why]`
- Metrics must be quantifiable with a named measurement method

---

## Constraints

- If the problem statement is unclear or solution is premature, say so directly
- Scope must list what's OUT explicitly, not just what's in
- Never fill generic content when context is missing — tell the user what's needed
- Every risk needs a mitigation or explicit ask for help
